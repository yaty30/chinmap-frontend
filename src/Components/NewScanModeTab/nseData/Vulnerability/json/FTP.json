By sending a large number of TELNET_IAC escape sequence, the proftpd process miscalculates the buffer length, and a remote attacker will be able to corrupt the stack and execute arbitrary code within the context of the proftpd process (CVE-2010-4221). Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability."
